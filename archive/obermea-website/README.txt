My design for the website, with useful information for the SEASONS model.

I made some minor changes to the SEASONS model that adds other attributes.

 --------------
|    SEASONS   |
 --------------
| year         |
| season MVP   |
| superbowl MVP|
| AFC Champ    |
| NFC Champ    |
| SB winner    |
| duration     |

 --------------

There is a difference between the Super Bowl MVP and Season MVP, so I made this distinction.
The description is just some other interesting information about the season, taken from some
 paragraphs on their corresponding Wikipedia page.

If you need anything of me, let me know on Slack. I'll check Slack once in a while during work.
